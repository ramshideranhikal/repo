## Step 4: Upload Files to GitHub

### 4.1 Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest Method)

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Delete the default README.md** (click on it, then click the trash icon)
3. **Upload your files:**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop ALL your project files
   - Make sure to maintain the folder structure
   - Write commit message: "Initial portfolio upload"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### 4.2 Important: Update Repository Name
1. **Edit `vite.config.ts`** in GitHub:
   - Click on the file in your repository
   - Click the pencil icon to edit
   - Change line 6 from:
     ```typescript
     base: '/portfolio-animated-text/',
     ```
     to:
     ```typescript
     base: '/portfolio/', // Use your actual repository name
     ```
   - Click "Commit changes"

---

## Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   - Click "Settings" tab (near the top)
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar

2. **Configure Pages:**
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" 
   - Folder: "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

3. **Wait for deployment:**
   - GitHub will show a message like "Your site is ready to be published"
   - It might take 5-10 minutes

---

## Step 6: Set Up GitHub Actions (Automated Deployment)

1. **Create a new file** in your repository:
   - Click "Add file" > "Create new file"
   - Name it: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Copy and paste this content:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

2. **Commit the file**

---

## Step 7: Update GitHub Pages Settings (Final Step)

1. **Go back to Settings > Pages**
2. **Change Source to:**
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
3. **Save**

---

## Step 8: See Your Live Portfolio! ðŸŽ‰

1. **Your website will be live at:**
   ```
   https://your-username.github.io/portfolio/
   ```

2. **Check the Actions tab** to see deployment progress:
   - Green checkmark = successful deployment
   - Red X = something went wrong (don't worry, we can fix it!)
